# Python AWS Infrastructure Automation

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an automated infrastructure deployment for a Python web application using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit). The infrastructure is designed to be scalable, secure, and highly available.

## Feachures

The project sets up a comprehensive AWS environment for hosting a Python web application. It includes:

- A custom VPC with public, private, and isolated subnets
- An Amazon RDS Aurora MySQL cluster for database operations
- An EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2 for the web server
- An Application Load Balancer for distributing incoming traffic
- Security groups to control network access
- IAM roles for EC2 instance permissions

## Key Components

### VPC

A custom VPC with a CIDR block of 10.10.0.0/16, including a NAT gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets.

### Database

An Amazon Aurora MySQL cluster in the isolated subnet for enhanced security.

### Web Server

An EC2 instance running in a private subnet with egress access.

### Load Balancer

An internet-facing Application Load Balancer to handle incoming traffic.

### Security

Carefully configured security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for each component.

## Deployment Process

The infrastructure is defined as code using AWS CDK, allowing for version-controlled, repeatable deployments. The Python web application will be deployed to the EC2 instance.

## Security Considerations

- The database is placed in an isolated subnet, not directly accessible from the internet.
- The web server is in a private subnet, accessed via the load balancer.
- Security groups are configured to allow only necessary traffic between components.

## Customization

The infrastructure can be easily customized by modifying the CDK stack definition. This includes changing instance types, adjusting security group rules, or modifying the database configuration.

## Conclusion

This project showcases best practices for deploying a Python web application on AWS, emphasizing security, scalability, and automation. It serves as an excellent starting point for developers looking to set up a robust AWS infrastructure for their Python applications.

# AWS Infrastructure Automation with CDK

This project uses AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to automate the deployment and management of AWS infrastructure. It provides a robust, code-based approach to defining and provisioning cloud resources, enabling Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.

## Project Overview

This CDK application is designed to create and manage AWS resources programmatically. It leverages the power of AWS CDK to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages, in this case, Python.

Key features of this project include:

- Infrastructure as Code: Define your AWS resources using Python, allowing for version control, code review, and consistent deployments.
- Automated Resource Management: Easily create, update, and delete AWS resources across multiple environments.
- Best Practices Implementation: Incorporates AWS recommended practices for resource configuration and security.
- Cross-Account and Cross-Region Support: Capable of managing resources across different AWS accounts and regions.

## Technical Stack

- AWS CDK: For defining cloud infrastructure as code
- Python: Primary programming language for CDK constructs
- AWS Services: Various AWS services as defined in the CDK stacks

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard CDK application structure:

- `app.py`: The entry point for the CDK application
- `cdk.json`: Contains CDK application configuration and context
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for the project
- `/cdkapp`: Directory containing the CDK stack definitions

## Getting Started

[Include instructions on how to set up and run the project]

## Deployment

To deploy the infrastructure:

cdk deploy

To destroy the created resources:
cdk destroy --all

## Configuration

The `cdk.json` file includes various configuration options and feature flags for AWS services. These can be adjusted based on specific project requirements.
